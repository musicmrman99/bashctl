Substitution Syntax:
    <{identifier:modifier[,modifier[,...]]}>

Description:
    The identifier spcify which value to substitute with. The modifiers specify
    what modifications to make to the substituted value.

Recognized identifiers:
    template, root, path, name
        These are substituted with the respective parameters given to 'create'.

Recognized modifiers:
    funcsafe
        This replaces any ' ' characters to '_' and any '/' characters with
        '__'. This should make whatever is given safe for a function identifier.

    varsafe
        This replaces any ' ' and '-' characters with '_' and any '/' characters
        with '__', then repeatedly deletes the first character until it is a
        lower or upper case letter, or an underscore, and finally deletes any
        character that is not a lower or upper case letter, a number, or an
        underscore. This should make whatever is given safe for a variable
        identifier.

    bashctl-reference
        This translates all '/' characters into ':' characters. This may help in
        making the 'path' identifier safe for use as a bashctl reference.
